I am a **Computer Engineering student at The University of Hong Kong (HKU)** with a strong interest in **robotics, embedded systems, and hardware–software integration**. I enjoy building real systems that interact with the physical world and learning through hands-on experimentation.

I am particularly interested in **robotics teleoperation, smart actuators, and safety-aware control**, and I plan to further explore **computer vision and machine learning** as part of future robotics projects.

## Interests and Focus Areas

1. Robotics systems and human–robot interaction
2. Embedded systems and smart actuators
3. Hardware–software integration
4. Computer vision for robotics (planned focus)
5. Machine learning for perception and control (planned focus)
6. Safety-aware system design

## Featured Projects

### (1) LeRobot SO101 — Bus-Servo Teleoperation System

A real-time teleoperation system for a **6-DOF robotic arm** using **daisy-chained smart servos (Dynamixel-style)** over a single TTL serial bus.

Key aspects:

1. Keyboard-based human-in-the-loop teleoperation
2. Safety joint limits derived from real calibration data
3. Command logging for analysis and reproducibility
4. Replay of recorded teleoperation trajectories
5. Clean separation of configuration, control, and hardware interface

### (2) Vision-Based PPE-Gated Tool Handover (In Progress)

An exploratory robotics project focused on **safety-gated human–robot interaction**.

Planned and current components:

1. Vision-based person and PPE detection
2. Decision logic that enables or blocks robot actions based on safety conditions
3. Robotic tool handover under controlled constraints
4. Study of perception reliability and real-world failure modes

This project is intentionally experimental and serves as a platform to learn and apply **computer vision and machine learning** in a physical robotics setting.
